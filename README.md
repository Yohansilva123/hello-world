# hello-world

I'm a graphic designer with some knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript very interested in learning more about web and software development.

I'm currently learning Python and trying to write my first application (integrating two digital marketing platforms) as well as an aggregator to display Market Data on a website.
